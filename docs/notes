A clustering mechanism is proposed to suggest items that are likely to follow such a purchase.

Recommender systems build an observation history of entity relationship events, e.g. customer-product transactions. This can be fed to some function, e.g. a non-supervised neural network, to produce suggestions. This is known as a collaborative filtering approach. When entity properties are involved in the function, this is known as a content-based approach. This project aims to build on existing entity properties through collaborative filtering.

    • Producing a simplistic end-to-end RS that may not address the project goal but will allow a throughput by which a high-level implementation can be tested
    • Adding individual units of features to the RS to build up the implementation
    • Both automated unit tests and end-to-end tests should be written in each developmental stage

This project should use both CF and CB, where CB is utilised to pad information regarding the items to aid in developing relationships. 

Online processing will process the user’s previous purchases against the model as per Linden et al. (2003).
