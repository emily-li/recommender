A clustering mechanism is proposed to suggest items that are likely to follow such a purchase.

This project should use both CF and CB, where CB is utilised to pad information regarding the items to aid in developing relationships. 

Tests:
    • Producing a simplistic end-to-end RS that may not address the project goal but will allow a throughput by which a high-level implementation can be tested
    • Adding individual units of features to the RS to build up the implementation
    • Both automated unit tests and end-to-end tests should be written in each developmental stage
